# WildersBook

:mag_right: [You can see the project here](https://orianemgn.github.io/WildersBook/)

:nerd_face: We did this project as part of the first Wild Code School project. The goal of this project was to make a one page website, using HTML and CSS and JavaScript (optional) and gitHub. 

We divided the work in the following way: 
- Andrei: Responsive navigation with opening a burger menu for mobile design. 

- Ahmed: Contact form with the use of javaScript

- Goerg: about school section for HTML and CSS practice

- Oriane: home and about us section, Wilders section. Use of javaScript and DOM manipulation. Changing data with javaScript.
